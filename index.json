If seduction doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, that proves they have a tight relationship that cannot be broken up by others. If, unfortunately, their spouse accepts the seduction, it also proves that they have made a wise decision because now they have solid evidence against their spouse(s). Human beings are such weird creatures and vulnerable in relationships. We are eager to be in love with our lovers and would like to be dominant in a relationship. However, we cannot suffer the pain if our lovers betray us. We are tortured by these feelings, so that it sounds more reasonable to get ahead in a relationship by hiring a wakaresaseya service.\nWe should realize that every individual is an independent organism, that\u0026rsquo;s why we cannot have full control over people, and expect them to follow our rules. Mutual respect and communication are key to maintaining a harmonious relationship, although we all know that is easier said than done.\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-7/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Human weakness and vulnerable relationships"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Save the world by eating insects Please find attached the notes from today, the handout on conditional types, and the homework for next time. Please watch this short video discussing the practice of eating insects as a form of food. Write a response where you answer the following questions:\n  Do you know of any societies or cultures where eating bugs is commonplace?\n  Do you think you could ever eat bugs for food? Have you ever eaten them before?\n  Do you think bugs could be a solution to the problem of poverty and malnutrition in the world?\n  As far as I know, people from south-east Asia like Cambodia and Laos like eating bugs. This includes/there are Ugly Bugs like flies and their maggots which might trigger sickness and a disgusted feeling in us, that\u0026rsquo;s why we tend to believe that those people who are eating bugs are savage and less civilized. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine why people would put those bugs into their mouths, we get goosebumps even watching them chewing and enjoying the bugs, we think those people are different from us, and they were born to eat insects.\nI think food is a cultural issue rather than people being programmed to be bug-eaters. Just like the people who lived inland like in Mongolia who believed that seafood is unclean, similarly, we also can\u0026rsquo;t understand why those people are so cruel because they eat dogs. I was convinced that eating bugs could be a solution to the shortage of food, after watching videos and articles. I think it is an eco-friendly way to maintain a sustainable life. Compared with the cattle industry, insect farming generates less carbon dioxide, consumes less energy and has less of a moral burden [has a smaller moral burden]. So maybe I should adjust my mind to give it a try, even though I have never eaten bugs before.\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-6/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Save the world by eating insects"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Mysterious black hole Please read this article about what would happen if you fell into a black hole.

(Interstellar, Star Trek, etc.) Do these agree with reality?\n  Do you prefer sci-fi that is realistic, or when it\u0026rsquo;s more fantastic?\n  Black Holes are so mysterious to us. They will pull and swallow everything that moves near them. Not even light can escape from there. So, it is hard to tell what it would look like inside, because no light would be reflected and captured by a telescope.\nIn the movie Interstellar, the man was trapped in a Black Hole, which was portrayed as a fancy place with an infinite time and space. I like this innovative way to tell a story even though I was pretty doubtful/skeptical of its truthfulness. I do believe that no one could survive and live to tell the story if they were sucked into a Black Hole.\nMy understanding about Black Holes mostly came from movies and documentaries. I have tried to read some scientific explanations but the abstract theories make my head spin. Therefore, I prefer sci-fi that is fantastic compare with sci-fi that is realistic. Jules Verne fictions were good examples that not just motivated many scientists to explore and create inventions but also inspired the creation of a lot of fiction and movies. For example, \u0026lsquo;Journey to the Center of the Earth\u0026rsquo; was such a great story that was full of imagination and I can\u0026rsquo;t even believe that it was published in 1864!\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-5/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Mysterious black hole"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Travel experiences Please read this article on the different types of travel that suit different kinds of people.

I like to explore different cultures and experience something different, to broaden my horizons and let my mind relax. Rather than just saying city vs nature, I prefer visiting small towns, which are usually not totally commercialized. You can avoid the crowds and enjoy the beautiful scenery. You can also taste the local cuisine at a cheaper price, and the people are friendly and hospitable. You can avoid the crowds and enjoy the beautiful scenery while also tasting the local cuisine at a cheaper price, and the people are friendly and hospitable.\nI still remember when I stayed in Australia for one year for a working holiday. I was fishing on the southwest Coast while enjoying the gentle breeze and beautiful sunset. I visited a vineyard in south Australia and enjoyed wine tastings, but I also crashed my car while I was driving to surrounding Tasmania island. Those are the greatest experiences that I have ever had. I had planned to do more things like sky diving and snorkeling, however later on I returned to Hong Kong and never came back. I told my friends that they should grasp opportunities to experience something different, because you never know if you will have a second chance to visit or experience that again.\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-4/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Travel experiences"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Being a spy Please watch this video about the disguises that spies used during the Cold War. Write a response answering the following questions:\n Were you surprised by any of the techniques or stories Jonna Mendez mentions in the video? Do you think you would be a good spy? Why or why not?  Being a spy might seem like a modern and fancy job, because we’ve seen many James Bond movies. For example, the spy can disappear into his disguises among a group of people, and get rid of his enemies easily. However, I am not surprised by the techniques that were shown in the video, such as wearing a costume or a mask. In fact, spies have existed along with human history. For example, in the past, when soldiers were being sent to enemy countries, they would pretend to be someone unremarkable like a farmer or business person. [They pretend to be unremarkable people, like farmers or business people.] They would collect information and send it back to their homeland via secret channels.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I would be a good spy. Because just/only wearing a costume or a mask will not make you a successful spy. It requires not only sophisticated technique and dedicated training, but also profound knowledge to act and behave like someone else. In addition, spies are patriotic, and they are always prepared to die for their countries. They would (past habitual) sacrifice themselves by swallowing a cyanide pill once they had been caught. [They would sacrifice themselves if they were caught. (imaginary)] Also, they must suffer enormous pressure when they’re sent to an isolated place. They have to keep their secret, because they would never know who their friends are as an undercover agent.\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-3/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Being a spy"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Personality type: introvert vs extravert Please read this article talking about different personality types. Write a response of 150-200 words addressing the following questions:\n  Do you think you\u0026rsquo;re more of an extrovert or an introvert?\n  How do you think being an introvert/extrovert affects you at work, at home, or with friends?\n  Do you think it\u0026rsquo;s better to be one way or the other?\n  I tend to be more like an introvert than an extrovert. When I was young, I realized that It was difficult for me to break the ice and get into a group of people by being sociable and talkative. I was usually quiet and sitting at the back, watching other people like an outsider. I am the kind of person who prefers to think more than act. [Is she very mean? - No, she\u0026rsquo;s not that kind of person.] Sometimes I wondered if there was something wrong with me because I seemed a bit different from other people.\nIn the old days, I tried many different ways to modify my behaviour, for example, going to the pub and disco, or hanging out with a large group of friends. But to be honest, I did not really enjoy it. I still prefer staying in a coffee shop and working alone or maybe with one or two close friends. Later on, I grew up and studied at university, and then I came across a few psychology subjects and realized that it was pretty normal to be an introvert. I felt relieved because I knew that I did not need to totally change myself to act like an extrovert to gain attention from other people, especially girls.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m still me, a middle-aged introvert. I adapt to the workplace. (workplace) I can stand up in the middle of a stage and give a presentation or talk to a large group of people, even though I am still terrified deep inside. I am more comfortable with myself and happy to be an introvert.\n","permalink":"https://chungleuk.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Personality type: introvert vs extravert"},{"categories":["English writing"],"contents":"Colonizing Mars please watch this short video discussing the possibility of humans colonizing Mars, and answer the following questions:\n  Do you think it\u0026rsquo;s important to focus on colonizing other planets, or should we pay more attention to our planet?\n  Do you think there will be people living on another planet in your lifetime?\n  Even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have a family to take care of, would you ever want to live on Mars?\n  Continuing to explore space would not only satisfy our curiosity but also better prepare us for colonization of other planets in the future. Our planet may no longer be suitable for living in the future due to pollution and overpopulation. Though we\u0026rsquo;ve made some progress on discovering Mars, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there will be people living on other planets in my lifetime.\nFirstly, there is still a long journey to go to settle up everything we need to survive on other planets: water, air and food. Also, we have to build a shelter that protects human beings from extreme temperatures and many other unexpected situations. Not many people are willing to be pioneers and risk their life living on other planets unless there are technical breakthroughs.\nSecondly, I believe that it would cost lots of money to launch the rocket and support the research. These resources should be better relocated to invent new ways to clean air pollution and provide renewable energy.\nThirdly, there will be people, and there will be problems and conflicts. The current issues on Earth such as corruption, poverty and health disparities will definitely happen once people migrate to other planets. It is not a one-time solution to the existing problems.\nRather than building a habitat like earth on other planets, I prefer staying on earth and doing whatever I can to sustain the health of this planet, such as living a more eco-friendly lifestyle.
